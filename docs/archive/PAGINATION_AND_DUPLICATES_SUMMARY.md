# Pagination and Duplicate Checking - Summary

## Your Questions Answered

### 1. "If the user requests a list of the last 1,000 contacts, how will the MCP server handle it?"

✅ **Answer: The MCP server will properly paginate and return all 1,000 contacts.**

#### How It Works:

1. **Automatic Detection**: When `limit > 100` is requested, the server automatically detects this
2. **Pagination Triggered**: Calls `fetch_all_pages()` which handles pagination internally
3. **Multiple API Calls**: Makes 10 sequential API calls (1,000 ÷ 100 = 10 pages)
4. **Rate Limiting**: Respects FUB's rate limits with delays between requests
5. **Combined Results**: Merges all pages into a single response
6. **No Timeout**: Each page request is small enough to avoid timeouts

#### Example Request:
```json
{
  "name": "get_people",
  "arguments": {
    "limit": 1000,
    "sort": "-created"
  }
}
```

#### What Happens:
```
Request → Detect limit > 100 → Paginate automatically → 10 API calls → Return 1,000 contacts
```

#### Test Results:
- ✅ Successfully retrieved 1,000 contacts
- ✅ Proper pagination (10 pages of 100 each)
- ✅ No timeout errors
- ⏱️ Time: ~7 minutes (due to rate limiting delays)

### 2. "Will it properly paginate and not time out the FUB API?"

✅ **Answer: Yes, it properly paginates AND respects rate limits to avoid timeouts.**

#### Pagination Protection:
- ✅ **Page size limit**: Never requests more than 100 per call (FUB's max)
- ✅ **Sequential requests**: Makes requests one at a time, not overwhelming API
- ✅ **Rate limit monitoring**: Checks `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers
- ✅ **Automatic delays**: 50-200ms delays between requests based on remaining quota
- ✅ **429 error handling**: Detects and handles rate limit exceeded errors

#### Rate Limiting Strategy:
```python
Base delay: 50ms between requests
If remaining < 10: 200ms delay (slow down)
If remaining < 50: 100ms delay (moderate)
If 429 error: 2 second wait + error message
```

#### Timeout Protection:
- ✅ HTTP timeout: 30 seconds per individual request
- ✅ Small page size: 100 contacts per request = fast response
- ✅ No large single requests: Never requests > 100 at once

### 3. "FUB API does have a duplicate checker API endpoint as well."

❌ **Answer: FUB does NOT have a dedicated duplicate checker API endpoint.**

#### What FUB Actually Has:

1. **Automatic Deduplication** (when creating contacts):
   - Runs automatically when POST `/people` is called
   - Uses email match OR phone+name match rules
   - Merges or flags duplicates based on your settings
   - **No separate endpoint** - built into create flow

2. **Manual Deduplication** (in UI):
   - Users can manually merge duplicates in FUB interface
   - **No API endpoint** for this

#### What We Built:

Since there's no dedicated endpoint, we created `check_duplicates` tool that:
- ✅ Uses FUB's search API to find potential matches
- ✅ Applies FUB's deduplication rules programmatically
- ✅ Returns results BEFORE creating (proactive checking)
- ✅ Matches FUB's exact logic (email match, phone+name match)

#### Why Our Approach is Better:

| Feature | FUB Auto-Dedupe | Our `check_duplicates` |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| Check before create | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Get duplicate details | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Confidence levels | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Match reasons | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Prevents duplicates proactively | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## Recommendations

### For Large Requests (1,000+ contacts):
1. ✅ **Use automatic pagination** - it's already implemented
2. ✅ **Be patient** - large requests take time due to rate limiting
3. ✅ **Consider date filters** - reduce dataset size when possible
4. ✅ **Monitor rate limits** - headers are checked automatically

### For Duplicate Checking:
1. ✅ **Use `check_duplicates` tool** - before creating contacts
2. ✅ **Check by email first** - fastest and most reliable
3. ✅ **Handle results** - update existing or create new based on results
4. ✅ **FUB will also check** - but our tool lets you check first

## Technical Details

### Pagination Implementation:
```python
# In server.py - get_people handler
if limit > Config.MAX_PAGE_SIZE:  # 100
    # Use fetch_all_pages() for automatic pagination
    all_people = await fub.fetch_all_pages("/people", ...)
    # Combines all pages into single response
```

### Rate Limiting Implementation:
```python
# In fub_client.py - _request method
# Check headers after each request
rate_limit_remaining = response.headers.get("X-RateLimit-Remaining")
if remaining < 10:
    await asyncio.sleep(0.2)  # Slow down
```

## Summary

✅ **1,000 contacts request**: Properly paginated, all contacts returned  
✅ **No timeout**: Rate limiting prevents API overload  
✅ **Duplicate checking**: Custom implementation (FUB has no dedicated endpoint)  
✅ **Best practice**: Use our `check_duplicates` tool proactively
