# Smart Date Filtering - FUB MCP Server

## ✅ NOW ACTIVE!

Your FUB MCP server now has intelligent date filtering that understands natural language date expressions!

---

## 🎯 What You Can Do

### Relative Dates
```python
get_people({
  "created": "last 7 days",
  "stageId": 2
})

get_people({
  "created": "last 30 days",
  "tags": "VIP"
})

get_people({
  "created": "last 1 week",
  "assignedUserId": 1
})

get_people({
  "created": "last 3 months"
})
```

### Comparative Dates
```python
get_people({
  "created": "older than 30 days",
  "stageId": 104  # Not Interested
})

get_people({
  "created": "older than 1 year"
})

get_people({
  "created": "older than 90 days",
  "assignedUserId": 1
})
```

### Named Periods
```python
get_people({
  "created": "today"
})

get_people({
  "created": "yesterday"
})

get_people({
  "created": "this week",
  "stageId": 2
})

get_people({
  "created": "this month"
})

get_people({
  "created": "this year"
})
```

### Raw Dates (Still Supported)
```python
get_people({
  "created": ">2024-01-01"  # After Jan 1, 2024
})

get_people({
  "created": "<2024-12-31"  # Before Dec 31, 2024
})

get_people({
  "created": "2024-10-31"  # Exact date
})
```

### Convenience Syntax
```python
# These are auto-converted
get_people({
  "createdInLast": "7 days",
  "stageId": 2
})

get_people({
  "updatedInLast": "30 days"
})
```

## 🔥 Real Examples from Test

### Example 1: Recent Leads
```python
get_people({
  "created": "last 7 days",
  "limit": 5
})

# Converted to: created=">2025-10-24"
# Found: 5 contacts
# Most recent: Test Dummy (2025-10-31)
```

### Example 2: This Month's Contacts
```python
get_people({
  "created": "this month",
  "stageId": 2  # Lead stage
})

# Converted to: created=">2025-10-01"
# Works perfectly with stage filtering!
```

### Example 3: Old Contacts to Follow Up
```python
get_people({
  "created": "older than 90 days",
  "stageId": 2,
  "limit": 10
})

# Converted to: created="<2025-08-02"
# Find contacts that need attention!
```

## 🎓 How It Works

1. **You write natural language**:
   ```python
   get_people({"created": "last 7 days"})
   ```

2. **Smart filter converts it**:
   ```python
   # Internally becomes:
   get_people({"created": ">2025-10-24"})
   ```

3. **FUB API receives proper format**:
   ```
   GET /v1/people?created=%3E2025-10-24
   ```

4. **You get results!** ✅

## 💡 Natural Language Queries in Cursor

Now these Cursor queries work automatically:

```
"Show me contacts from the last 7 days"
→ get_people({"created": "last 7 days"})

"Find leads created this month in Active stage"
→ get_people({"created": "this month", "stageId": 115})

"Show me old contacts from 90+ days ago"
→ get_people({"created": "older than 90 days"})

"Get today's new contacts"
→ get_people({"created": "today"})

"Show me this week's leads assigned to me"
→ get_people({"created": "this week", "assignedUserId": 1})
```

---

## 🔗 Combined with Other Filters

Smart dates work with **everything**:

```python
# Stage + Date
get_people({
  "stageId": 2,
  "created": "last 30 days"
})

# User + Date
get_people({
  "assignedUserId": 1,
  "created": "this week"
})

# Source + Date
get_people({
  "sourceId": 210,
  "created": "last 7 days"
})

# Tags + Date
get_people({
  "tags": "VIP",
  "created": "this month"
})

# Search + Date
get_people({
  "search": "John",
  "created": "last 30 days"
})

# Multiple Filters + Date
get_people({
  "stageId": 115,
  "assignedUserId": 1,
  "created": "last 7 days",
  "tags": "Hot Lead"
})
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Follow-Up Campaigns
```python
# Contacts added last week that need follow-up
get_people({
  "created": "last 1 week",
  "stageId": 2,  # Lead
  "assignedUserId": 1
})
```

### 2. Stale Lead Detection
```python
# Leads over 90 days old still in Lead stage
get_people({
  "created": "older than 90 days",
  "stageId": 2,
  "sort": "created"  # Oldest first
})
```

### 3. Performance Tracking
```python
# This month's new leads
get_people({
  "created": "this month",
  "limit": 100
})

# Compare to last month (manual date)
get_people({
  "created": ">2024-09-01",
  "created": "<2024-10-01",
  "limit": 100
})
```

### 4. Daily Review
```python
# Today's new contacts
get_people({
  "created": "today",
  "sort": "-created"
})

# Yesterday's additions
get_people({
  "created": "yesterday"
})
```

### 5. Nurture Campaigns
```python
# 30-day old leads for nurture sequence
get_people({
  "created": "older than 30 days",
  "stageId": 2,
  "tags": "Nurture"
})
```

})
```

## 🎉 Summary

**Question**: Does filtering allow smart filtering of date fields?

**Answer**: YES! ✅ As of now!

You can use:
- ✅ Natural language ("last 7 days", "this month")
- ✅ Relative dates ("older than 30 days")
- ✅ Named periods ("today", "this week")
- ✅ Raw dates (">2024-01-01")
- ✅ Convenience syntax (`createdInLast`)
- ✅ Combined with any other filter
- ✅ On both `created` and `updated` fields

**It just works!** The AI in Cursor will automatically use these when you ask date-related questions. 🚀
